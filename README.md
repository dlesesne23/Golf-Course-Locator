# Golf-Course-Locator
This system locates and rates golf courses in your area based off of previous reviews, difficulty of the course, and average price per round

# How It Works
This app will locate the best golf courses for avid golfers of all skill levels. Simply sign up (It's free!) and enter the location you want to play golf at, the app will give you a list of golf courses to choose from based on golf course difficulty level, price, and overall quality of the course. All you need to do is choose one, and make a tee time at their website, which will be linked.

## MVP Goals
My MVP goal is to have the app fully functional based on the above description. I would like to be able to let people create an account and have the app store their information. I would like to be able to pull from a golf course API and use that to properly locate the courses based off of the users location

## Technologies Used
Full MVC, Mongoose, Express, Node.js. I will also use Javascript and CSS

## Stretch Goals
I really want to build a fully interactive golf website/app, and would like golf to be the focus of my future projects as well. 

-   With this specific app, I'd eventually like to have users be able to create tee times directly on the app.

-   I'd like users to add comments and reviews of their own to these golf courses. These reviews will update the overall golf course rating.

-   User interactivity. Users will be able to make their own lists of courses they have played and rank and explain them. Users can make this information public and other users will be able to see their lists.
